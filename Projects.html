            <span>&#8226;</span> Owlrabbit (Will Add Link Soon!)

            <br>

            &emsp; >This is an indie 2D platformer game project inspired by 2D Metroidvania style games with other influences such as HollowKnight, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and Celeste. This game also utalizes a stance system to &emsp;&emsp;accurately simulate traditional swordsmanship. This project is being created in Unity by a team based out of Canada that I am part of. The channel is a bit barebones right now as we are early in development, but &emsp;&emsp;hopefully that will change soon!

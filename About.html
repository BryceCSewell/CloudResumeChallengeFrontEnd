        <div class="introduction">
            <p>
                &emsp; I've spent the last 5 years working with all sorts of programming languages inside and outside of my studies at the University of Texas at Arlington. During that time, I have worked in a few different areas of the programming world: frontend, backend, and fullstack developer positions, as well as, an IT Help Desk position. <br>
                
                <br>               
                
                &emsp; I have always found cloud computing fascinating and have been wanting to learn how it works and well... here we are! This is my very first cloud application! <br> 
                
                <br>
                
                &emsp; A little bit about me in general, outside of work you can find me working on personal music projects under the name B Sewell. I am hoping to start playing some live shows in the DFW area soon, so if you're reading this and are from DFW I'd love to see you there! <br> 
                
                <br>
                
                &emsp; Other than that, some other hobbies of mine include playing video games (of which my favorite series to date is Kingdom Hearts), studying music production, working out, studying Japanese, auditioning for voice acting positions, and using my voice acting chops to DM some DnD campaigns I run with friends! <br>
                
                <br>
                
                &emsp; For the time being, that's all I really have to say about myself. I hope to speak with you soon! <br>

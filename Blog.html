            &emsp;Hello! Welcome to the Blog page! As you know, my name is Bryce Sewell. I am a CSE graduate, musician, and voice actor! I'm sure you've already seen the about page so I won't regugitate all that info. Anyways, today is my first day working on my Cloud Resume Challenge. Today I created my S3 bucket to start my cloud resume challenge. Just some basic set up, nothing super fancy. Also coded my resume into an HTML document and added it to the bucket. Not much to report today honestly other than I got my domain name verified. I'm excited to keep working on this and I'll talk to you on my next entry!

            &emsp;Today I did a little more coding and created the Home page. This page consists of an introduction of my name and some links to go to. The top links refer to different pages to this site and the icons refer to different social medias that I have. Again, not a lot that was super fascinating today. I did mostly setup and html/css work for the home page.

            &emsp;Took a break over the weekend to let my brain rest. This plus studying for the SAA-C03 exam has fried my brain lol. Today, I created the About page and made a placeholder page for my Projects tab. Got all of that uploaded to S3. Also got an SSL cert for my DNS and set up CloudFront for the S3 bucket. I’m actually writing this while I wait for the CloudFront to deploy.

            <br>
            
            &emsp;It’s deployed and I am able to access it from the Distribution Name. Sweet! Next I just need to figure out how to allow my registered domain to access the site.

            <br>
            
            &emsp;So I figured out how to get my domain name working, I just forgot to make two records in ACM for both IPv6 and IPv4. It’s working now. Only downside is that the end user has to specify the page they want to go to to get the home page. I’ll have to look into this tomorrow or some other day this week.

            &emsp;Today, I got to work with DNS (Route 53), SSL, Aliases, CloudFront Distribution, S3 buckets, as well as a little bit of coding on the side to make my site look somewhat professional lol. As far as the cloud resume challenge goes, I am about halfway through. Next I need to program a page view counter in JS and create a database.

            &emsp;Took another small break. Worked with API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, and some IAM today. Created the database and created a function that will increment when the API is called. Used IAM to give the lambda function permission to update the database. Updated my HTML homepage file with a function that will call the API gateway when the window is opened. Now I am just having trouble getting the API to deploy. Will look into this further tomorrow. Good progress done today though. Today I ended on step 9 (step 8 if you want to be a stickler) of the Cloud Resume Challenge. I’m really close to being done. This is exciting.

            &emsp;These blog posts are far between, sorry. That can be expected for the rest of this project though. This plus working a full time job and other responsibilities of being an adult lead to very little time to work on personal projects unfortunately. Regardless. I fixed the API and Lambda issue! I had the incorrect link in my fetch function so I needed to depoy my API to the prod stage and add the correct URL. I had the Lambda functions URL as opposed to the APIs URL. After a couple video calls with some friends of mine in the coding world, we were able to find that the URL was incorrect and that my CORS was set up incorrectly. Also, I hate CORS.

            &emsp;Successfully created a CodePipeline that updates my website when I push new code to my github. I need to fix the buildspec.yml file, something is misfiring and causing the build to fail. I will be doing that later. Still need to do Cloudformation parts and test cases.

            &emsp;Fixed the buildspec.yml file. Stupid typos lol. Still wildly unsure on how SAM works, so I won’t be delving into the CloudFormation stuff just yet. Will most likely spend some time watching videos on SAM and reading documentation. Now that I have implemented the back end building, my visitor counter is not working. 
            
            <br>

            <br>

            &emsp;Found the issue and made a temporary fix. There seems to be an error regarding the build. Not sure where the error is but when I build the backend, it sets the function name incorrectly and I have to go in and manually change the name of the Lambda Handler function. I’ll dig more into this later, but for now the issue is fixed and I do not see a need to build my backend again.

            <br>
            
            &emsp;Finally, (for the most part) my cloud resume challenge is finished. There are a couple things I haven’t done yet (i.e. build unittest for the lambda function and create a SAM model via CloudFormation), but I am satisfied for now. I will work on finishing up the last few pages on the website in the next couple of days (updating my blog page with all of these entries and filling out my projects page).

            &emsp;I’ve learned a lot already through these small actions. Still confused on some things, but I do feel much more equipped regarding the AWS Cloud than I was a month ago. I’ll update this as I see fit when I create new projects or update the site. Also, checkout my github if you want to see the files I have that I used to create this webpage! For now, ta ta!

            P.S. HUGE shoutout to Melissa Richard and all of her documentation. That helped me a ton when I got stuck on a roadblock. Here is her series of blog posts if you want to check her out! <a href="https://medium.com/@devhellomello">https://medium.com/@devhellomello</a>
